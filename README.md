## Why RakshaLink exists

According to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (*Road Accidents in India 2023*, as cited in our idea deck), India recorded **4,80,583 road accidents** and **1,72,890 deaths** in 2023, about **20 deaths every hour**. Most emergency apps assume you have signal, can unlock your phone, and can say clearly what you need. On a highway, you often can't.

<!-- TODO(G6): re-verify every figure above against the MoRTH report before submission. -->

RakshaLink is built for that moment: one tap, one spoken sentence, or **no tap at all**.

## What it does

*These are our design goals. The [Build status](#build-status) table shows what is actually live.*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Four emergencies, four colours** | Fuel, Breakdown, Accident, Medical SOS. Each routes to the *right kind* of responder, not a generic dispatch. |
| **Explainable triage** | Deterministic rules map the emergency to responder types and find the nearest ones by real distance. Anything an AI model suggests is validated against the four known categories before it can act. |
| **Drive Mode (crash-aware)** | The phone watches for a hard impact followed by a sudden stop. A single bump or speed breaker never triggers it. If it does fire, a **20-second alarm countdown** lets you cancel. If you can't, help is sent for you. |
| **A responder side, not just a victim side** | A desktop **Responder Console** and a mobile accept page. Responders go on duty, see an alert ring with a countdown, accept or decline, then mark On the way, Arrived and Resolved. The rider sees only real statuses. |
| **Escalation, not hope** | If nobody accepts in time, the alert moves to the next-nearest responder. If everyone fails, the app says so and puts **Call 112** front and centre. |
| **Offline ladder** | Data works: call the API. No data: a prefilled SMS. No signal: a Morse SOS flash and sound for people nearby, and the alert is queued until signal returns. |

### How it compares with a plain SOS button

| | Plain SOS button | RakshaLink (design goal) |
|---|---|---|
| Routes by emergency type | one generic dispatch | hospital, police, mechanic or fuel pump |
| Works if the victim cannot tap | no | Drive Mode crash countdown |
| Responder side with accept and status steps | rarely | Responder Console and accept page |
| Handles "nobody answered" | silent | escalates, then tells the rider to call 112 |
| Weak or no signal | fails | SMS fallback, Morse flash, saved queue |

> RakshaLink **augments** India's 112 emergency number; it does not replace it. A Call 112 button is on every screen.

```mermaid

    participant R as Rider app
    participant S as API and triage
    participant P as Responder
    R->>S: SOS with category and location
    S->>S: pick responder types, find nearest
    S->>P: SMS, voice call and accept link
    alt accepted in time
        P->>S: Accept
        S->>R: Responder accepted
    else no answer
        S->>P: escalate to next-nearest responder
        S->>R: If all fail, No responder answered. Call 112.
    end
```

### Drive Mode: crash detection that avoids false alarms

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> Armed: driving speed held
    Armed --> Verifying: hard impact
    Verifying --> Armed: speed continues, so it was a bump
    Verifying --> Countdown: sudden stop
    Countdown --> Armed: I am OK
    Countdown --> SOS: 20 s with no cancel
    SOS --> [*]
```

Speed context, an impact spike, and a sudden stop must all agree. Thresholds are starting values and are **not validated on real crashes**. See [docs/SAFETY_AND_HONESTY.md](docs/SAFETY_AND_HONESTY.md).

## Design

Calm under stress: big targets, plain words, one dominant action per screen, and one colour per emergency (Fuel green, Breakdown teal, Accident navy, Medical maroon).

## Getting started

Setup steps are added at the final gate of the hackathon, once the code exists. Planned configuration names are in [`.env.example`](.env.example).

## Safety and honesty

- **Demo mode by default.** Alerts go only to team-owned test numbers. No real hospital, police station, or emergency service is ever contacted.
- **The responder network in the demo is simulated** and labelled so. Responder locations come from OpenStreetMap. Phone numbers are demo numbers.
- **The app never says help is coming unless a responder actually accepted.**
- **Dispatch can run in simulation mode**, and simulated dispatch is always labelled as such.
- Motion data stays on the phone. Only a short summary is sent when an alert fires.

Full details: [docs/SAFETY_AND_HONESTY.md](docs/SAFETY_AND_HONESTY.md).

## Roadmap

Proposals, not commitments: one pilot highway corridor, then state highways, then a national network, with responder onboarding done together with official systems such as 112. See [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md).
